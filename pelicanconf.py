ABOUT_ME = """
I am a data analyst living in Minneapolis.
<br></br>
Though I work in banking now, I had my come-up working in political campaign data, beginning as a field organizer and eventually becoming a Statewide Data Director in Michigan.  I spent a lot of my time <del> fighting</del> working with Excel but became annoyed with its limitations as I focused more on data analysis.  Somewhere along the line, I was introduced to R, then Python, and the rest is history.  It was an instant nerd crush and I have been expanding my data programming skills since.  This blog is my valentine to the possibilities of what can be accomplished with data.
<br></br>
When not dealing with numbers, I can be found running, biking, and enjoying a beer on a patio.
