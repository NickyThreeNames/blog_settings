Tldr; Great class, learned a lot!

It’s a really interesting [class](http://www.statistics.com/persuasion-analytics/) taught by [Ken Strasma](http://haystaqdna.com/about/) that covers campaign targeting, micro-targeting theory, and application using  (anonymized) data. Having access to live candidate and partisanship IDs, demographic data, and commercial data was awesome to the model building process. In the class you build partisanship, candidate, and persuadability models. Additionally, there is a lot of material on evaluating the models and describing how/when to use them during a campaign. 

There are tracks available for all levels of technical ability with an Excel track and an R/Python track for those looking for a more technical challenge. 

###Week 1
Targeting basics by campaign phase and voter contact basics. 
History of modern micro-targeting
Basics of why campaigns should use targeting.

###Week 2
Microtargeting vs traditional geographic and demographic targeting. 
Survey and experiment design basics. 
Modeling basics covering Linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees. 
Build and evaluate partisanship models and voter turnout models.

###Week 3
Build candidate ID models and persuasion models. 
Measuring lift from previous models
Deriving predictors from voter file data. 
Create and compare ensemble models.

###Week 4
Targeting for TV, online and social media. 
Applying models created previously to budget and target direct mail
Campaign strategy using micro-targeting.

Additionally there were some great discussions about polling and applying micro-targeting more effectively in campaigns. Ken Strasma is always active on the message boards and it was really interesting to hear his perspective on the 2016 polling fiasco.

Very accessible to a wide variety of backgrounds. You have a lot o

**Pros:**
Lectures are interesting
Covers a lot of topics
Practice with good examples
Instructions for Python, R, or Excel
Replies quickly to the boards

**Cons:**
Could have used more feedback on the modeling process
Never quite got used to the forums for conversations with classmates
TV and social media is light on practice despite good background info

FYI – The lectures are in PDFs. I like to read when learning new stuff but I can understand that not everyone does. Just seemed worth mentioning.

Side note, this class did validate my position that middle scores (30-60%) on partisanship/likely dem models are not swing voters but instead are people the model cannot effectively categorize. Rough drafts of my Jupyter notebooks from the class are on Github [here](https://github.com/NickyThreeNames/persuadeanalytics).

Overall, I highly recommend the class! It was good to have a chance to learn from the master.
