Summary: Hello World.

Welcome to the first post of the PolitiNerd Blog.

This blog is focused on using Python and R for political data with a focus on Minnesota because I still occasionally miss working in campaigns.  My goal is to be a blog I would have read while I was coming up in the biz.

Besides that unnecessarily lofty goal, it is also a good excuse for me to play around with political data and try out new stuff.  Plus, all of the cool kids have a blog these days.

Thanks for reading!
