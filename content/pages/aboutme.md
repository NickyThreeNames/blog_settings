Summary: About Me

I am a data analyst working in banking and living in Minneapolis.

Previously, I worked in campaigns moving from field organizing to working as a Statewide Data Director.  I spent a lot of my time working/fighting with Excel especially as I focused more on data analysis.  Somewhere along the line, I was introduced to R, and then Python.  This has really sparked my interest about what could be accomplished with data.  It was an instant nerd crush and I have been expanding my data programming skills since.

When not dealing with numbers, I enjoy running, biking, and enjoying a beer on a patio.
